**Q: What is the difference between local power and effective power?**

A: Local power and effective power may exhibit differences:

Local power: The power committed by the miner over a recent period. \
Effective power: The power committed by the miner that has been successfully verified by the server over a recent period.

Theoretically, these two power values should align. However, factors such as network stability, local operational integrity, and the performance of the graphics card during the commitment process can lead to power loss.

For instance, if your local power is 1M/s and you experience a loss of 20K/s due to various circumstances, your effective power would amount to 980K/s.
